# The Role of Personality and Linguistic Patterns in Discriminating Between Fake News Spreaders and Fact Checkers

The collection and the code can be used for the task of differentiating between users the spread fake news (fake news spreaders) and those that refute them (fact-checkers)

The collection is seperated into training, development and test sets. Each file contains the username (anonymised), the label (0 for fact-checkers and 1 for spreaders) and the 1,000 most recent tweets per user. Due to Twitter constraints we provide the ids of the tweets and not the text.
